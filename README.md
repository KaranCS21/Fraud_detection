# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using the XGBoost algorithm. It applies data preprocessing techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), scaling, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to handle class imbalance, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction.

## Project Overview

This project is based on a dataset containing credit card transaction records, where the goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. Class imbalance is handled using the SMOTE technique, and the XGBoost algorithm is used for classification.
